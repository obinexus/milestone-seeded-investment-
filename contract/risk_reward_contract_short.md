# Risk / Reward Contract — Short Summary (Public)

This is the public, non-binding summary of the Risk/Reward Contract Framework used as a design reference for milestone-seeded investment.

## Purpose
To define how milestones are proposed, verified, and paid under a constitutional governance model while protecting participant dignity and reducing "ghosting."

## Key Concepts (short)
- **Milestone:** a scoped deliverable with acceptance criteria, proof artifacts, and a verification path.
- **Actor Roles:** HITL (decision authority), HOTL (audit supervisor), HOUTL (automated tasks).
- **Coherence threshold:** projects with `coherence_score ≥ 95.4` qualify for automated verification flows; `<95.4` triggers human review.
- **#NoGhosting:** automated monitoring enforces response windows; repeated silence triggers escalation.
- **Entrapment Diagnostics:** 8 algorithmic patterns that detect abusive system behaviours (Improbability, Exhaustion, Loopback, Silence, Assertion, Contradiction, Intimidability, Tripling).

## Payment & Escrow (summary)
- Payments released only after verification criteria are met.
- Escrow suggested for T2+ projects; third-party audit recommended for T3 tiers.
- Example release windows: T1 (7 days), T2 (14 days), T3A (21 days), T3B (30 days).

## Public use
- Use this summary for community discussion, feedback, and synthetic testing.
- Do *not* treat this file as an enforceable contract.
